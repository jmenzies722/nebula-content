// Declare a variable and assign it to a numeric value
// Double that value and re-assign it to the previous variable

// Create two even numbers, assign them to variables and divide one from the other

// Create a variable and log it's remainder, if divided by 3, to the console

// Answer in plain text, what is modulo especially useful for?

// This is used to find the remainder of an expression 
// for example 3/3 = 1 and 3%3 is remainder 0
