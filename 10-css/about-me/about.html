        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>Welcome everyone ðŸ‘‹, My name is Josh, and I'm passionate about Software Engineering, web development, and AI</h2>
        <p>Just a little about me... I'm 21 years old, and I was born on the Leo/Cancer cusp. I developed a keen interest in computers and technology at a young age, which motivated me to continuously expand my skillset over the years. Recently, I graduated from the University of Hartford with a BS in Computer Engineering and a Minor in Computer Science!</p>
